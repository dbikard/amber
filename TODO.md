# Amber — TODO

**Live:** https://dbikard.github.io/amber/ · repo: github.com/dbikard/amber

## Phase 0 — Headless core + tracers (MVP foundation)
- [x] Docs (vision / principles / CLAUDE / TODO)
- [x] `rng.js`, `const.js`, `world.js`: full sim (economy, buildings, units, combat, chaos,
      powers, pattern walk, win conditions) running headless
- [x] `ai.js`: random / greedy baselines + Julian, Bleys, Brand, Benedict
- [x] `sim.js` suites: mirror, gradient, round-robin, durations — targets green
- [x] Browser: sprites, render, HUD, build/upgrade sheets, powers, single-player vs AI
- [x] LAN: perils pairing ported + host-authoritative snapshot sync (2P duel)
- [x] Playwright smoke test (boots, menu → match, no console errors)
- [ ] Deploy: repo + GitHub Pages

## Phase 1 — Feel & fairness
- [ ] Human playtest pass: tune essence pacing, tower efficiency, chaos curve
- [ ] Mechanic ablation runs (each building/power must move win rates)
- [ ] Guest-side interpolation polish; reconnect/disconnect UX
- [ ] Victory/defeat presentation (Pattern blaze / castle fall)

## Phase 2 — Content
- [ ] More Trumps (hero variety), 5th building?, per-heir portraits on menu/end screens
- [ ] Campaign framing text between ladder rungs (Zelazny-flavored)
- [ ] Audio (procedural, perils-style sfx.js)

## Phase 3 — 4-player LAN
- [ ] Host-as-hub star topology (per perils COOP_4P_PLAN.md), lobby, bots fill empty seats

## Phase 4 — Polish + infra
- [ ] PWA (manifest, sw, icons), version-bump pre-commit hook
- [ ] Rebma / Tir-na Nog'th expansions, Jewel weather control

## Known decisions
- Host-authoritative netcode (not lockstep) — fog of war + no cross-browser determinism trust.
- Pattern walk is an *instant win at 100%* but revealed at start — the anti-stall keystone.
- One screen, no camera pan (MVP); portrait-first.
